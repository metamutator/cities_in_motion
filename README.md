# Setup
You want to create a conda environment first with all the necessary libraries. The easiest way to do this is to executing the following at a terminal of your choice (for instance, the terminal within Visual Studio Code):
``conda env create -f cities_env.yml``

# Running the app
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a conda environment using the YML file (as stated above)
3. Activate the environment in the terminal ( ``conda activate cities_in_motion``) 
4. Hit ``streamlit run streamlit.py``

This should open up the app in your browser. Alternatively, you may access the [live app here](https://share.streamlit.io/metamutator/cities_in_motion/main/streamlit.py)
